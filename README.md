# ZOMATO_Sales_Analysis_Dashboard
## Project Objectives
The main objective of this project is to develop an interactive dashboard that helps visualize and analyze Zomatoâ€™s sales, user activity, and city-level performance. It aims to turn raw data into actionable insights for better business decisions, identifying growth trends, user demographics, and high-performing locations.

## Question (KPIs)
- What is the total sales amount and order quantity over the analysis period?
- How many active users, new users, and lost users are there, segmented by gender?
- Which age groups and cities contribute the most to user base and sales?
- What are the top cities by sales amount, order quantity, and user ratings?
- How do sales trends change year by year?
- What is the share of different product categories in total sales and their respective ratings?

## Project Insights 
- The dashboard revealed that Tirupati leads in total sales amount, while Bikaner excels in user count and ratings.
- Most users are young adults, especially in the 20-30 age group, contributing significantly to active user and sales figures.
- More males were lost and gained as users compared to females, highlighting opportunities for targeted engagement.
- Non-veg and veg categories comprise the majority of sales, with veg slightly ahead in sales amount despite having a lower rating count.
- Sales peaked in 2018 and have since declined, indicating a need to investigate factors causing the drop and devise strategies for recovery.
